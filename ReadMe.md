# To-do Application 

This is a full stack to-do application made using React, MongoDB, Express and Node. 
<br>
I learned to REST web services during this project and, learned to make GET, POST, DELETE requests to the server. 

## Glipses of the Website

The red button on each task on the right is used to delete the tasks, to create a new task we need to click on the add button at the bottom right of the screen.
